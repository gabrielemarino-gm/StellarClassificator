# StellarClassificator
In this data mining project, we aimed to tackle the challenge of classifying celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their optical spectra. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests, and Bayesian Classifier.

Our project involved several key steps:

## Data Preprocessing: 
We performed preprocessing on the dataset, including the application of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the minority classes. This step was crucial to ensure the models could effectively learn from the data.

## Model Training: 
We trained the classification models using a robust 10-fold cross-validation technique. This approach helped assess the models' performance and ensured their generalizability.

## User-Friendly Application: 
To make our models accessible to users, we developed a user-friendly application with an intuitive interface. This application allows users to input optical spectra data and obtain predictions on whether the celestial object is a star, galaxy, or quasar.

We used the Stellar Classification Dataset, which can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17/data">Stellar Classification Dataset<\a>.

Overall, this project showcases the power of data mining and machine learning techniques in solving complex astronomical classification problems and provides a practical tool for users interested in identifying celestial objects from optical spectra.
