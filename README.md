# StellarClassificator
In this data mining project, I aimed to tackle the challenge of classifying celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their optical spectra. To achieve this, I conducted a comprehensive comparison of various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests, and Bayesian Classifier.

My project involved several key steps:

## Data Preprocessing: 
I performed preprocessing on the dataset, including the application of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the minority classes. This step was crucial to ensure the models could effectively learn from the data.

## Model Training: 
I trained the classification models using a robust 10-fold cross-validation technique. This approach helped assess the models' performance and ensured their generalizability.

## User-Friendly Application: 
To make my model accessible to users, I developed a user-friendly application with an intuitive interface. This application allows users to input optical spectra data and obtain predictions on whether the celestial object is a star, galaxy, or quasar.

## Dataset
I used the Stellar Classification Dataset, which can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17/data">Stellar Classification Dataset</a>.

Overall, this project showcases the power of data mining and machine learning techniques in solving complex astronomical classification problems and provides a practical tool for users interested in identifying celestial objects from optical spectra.
